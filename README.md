##Assignment 1
Design a simple Neural Network on MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset. You can decide the number of layers and number of neurons in your network. Use cross entropy loss function with adam optimizer for your model. The performance measurement can be done in terms of accuracy. Compare the performances of at least two different models created by you by varying the number of layers and number of neurons in hidden layers. Also write an analysis of your two models in terms of number of parameters and epochs.
